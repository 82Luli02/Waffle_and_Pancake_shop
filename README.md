### Project Title
Waffle and Pancake shop system

### Overview

This Java program enables the user to prepare his/her order by choose from menu of options, enter the required information such as the number of pieces and the  type  of extra sauces or toppings and the system will show the recite in the end of order. 

### Description

In this project, I wrote a small Java program about the Waffle and Pancake Shop system that allows the users to buy special kinds of sweets (waffles and pancakes). It also lets users add extra sauces (like chocolate and caramel) and toppings (like strawberry and banana).Â 

The users/customers have to Enter the number of pieces they want. Of course, the cost of the order is based on the type of sweet(pancake or waffle) and the extra sauces or toppings. 

### Implementation
* Input validation

The user has to enter 1 for Waffle, 2 for pancake, or 3 for exiting from the program. 

1) If the user enters incorrect information in the main menu, the program will display "Sorry! wrong input ,Try Arain (Y / N)?)", and prompt the user to re-enter the information

2) If the user's input is not recognized in the Sauces and Toppings menu, the program will display "Sorry! Wrong Input, Exiting the program".
